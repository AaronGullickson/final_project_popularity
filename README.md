# Popularity and Substance Use among Adolescents

Public health researchers have long been concerned about the effect of peer pressure and social networks on adolescents’ use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. The National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) provides an important opportunity to study such effects because it contains data on both substance use and students’ social networks. Students were asked to nominate their closest friends within the same school. We can use this information to construct a measure of poplarity by counting the number of friend nominations each student received. We will use Add Health data to address the following research questions:

1. How does smoking and alcohol use affect a student’s popularity, as measured by the number of friend nominations received?
2. How does substance use (alcohol and tobacco) affect the relationship between sports participation and popularity?

For both questions, you should consider control variables for student race, gender, academic performance, and extra-curricular activities.

The Add Health data we will use are provided in the `input` directory as a RData file. The README in that directory also contains further information about the survey and the variables that we will use.
